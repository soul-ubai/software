       <h5>HOW IT WORKS</h5>
       UPI is not a university and does not offer degree
       programs.UPI is a practical skill acquisition center.
       Our approach is quite different from the normal.Here,
       students learn by doing,they acquire competency skills by 
       experiencing and exposing themselves to things.A hub where
       students learn with industry standard software ,machines,
       tools and equipment.A program that seeks to equip UPI
       students with actual experience to work as professionals
       by the time they complete.


      <h2>Creativity and innovation should be an intrgral part
      	of our educational system.An approach where students are 
      	able to solve real skills coupled with innovation and creativity.
      	Everyone is unique and special, but it can only manifest
      	if they do what they love.
